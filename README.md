Small utilities that simplify the life!

1) mailer/mailer.js

Built to be used with NodeJS, mailer.js sends personalized emails to a group of recipients.

Emails have a customized message as well as common message.

Great utility for sending farewell/keep_in_touch emails while resigning from a job! :-)

Steps to execute:
  1. Install node.js (http://nodejs.org/)
  2. Copy this file to a directory of your choice E.g.: ~/mailer.js
  3. Update sections that have comments starting with "Setup"
  4. Execute: node mailer.js

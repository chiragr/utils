Small utilities that simplify the life!

1) mailer/mailer.js

Built to be used with NodeJS, mailer.js sends personalized emails to a group of recipients.

Emails have a customized message as well as common message.

Great utility for sending farewell/keep_in_touch emails while resigning from a job.
